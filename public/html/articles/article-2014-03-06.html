            Weighing In: Jimmer Fredette Starting Over

        <p class="lead text-center">
            Former Kings G Jimmer Fredette was released last week, after three ineffective years in Sacramento.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Since Draft Day in 2011, you could say I saw this coming.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            When Jimmer Fredette was released by the organization on February 27, it wasn’t really a surprise to me. It was bound to happen, considering they already had their point guard in Isaiah Thomas, and couldn’t find a use for him on the roster anymore. Either that, or it was a proper “mercy killing” – a mutual agreement that the man known to many as “The Jimmer” during his BYU days needed a new place to call home. Fortunately for him, he found that place in Chicago.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Now he has the opportunity to be the player he was meant to be in the NBA. Not the franchise point guard that Sacramento envisioned he would be when they agreed with the Milwaukee Bucks to trade for him when he was taken 10th overall in 2011. Not the all-world shooter who could hit from anywhere on the floor, maybe in the same vein a young Peja Stojakovic could back in the early 2000s. But the long-range specialist who could bring sharpshooting to a squad in need of offense. A situational player that could come off the bench and provide a morale boost through his shooting touch. Nothing more, nothing less.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            This isn’t necessarily a terrible thing. After all, players like Steve Kerr and J.J. Redick found their niches in the league, and thrived from their positions. But no one was going to mistake them for the All-Star playmakers that are usually taken with a top 10 pick in the NBA Draft.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            When all was said and done, Fredette was one in a long line of victims of the Hype Game. He was lauded as the country’s best long-range shooter, who could create a shot from anywhere on the floor while at BYU. He was dynamic, he was unique, and he was a media darling. And for a team like Sacramento, who, at the time, was struggling to put butts in seats for a crumbling old stadium and mired in the NBA basement, he seemed like a godsend.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Now, less than three years later, he’s in a Chicago Bulls uniform – a seemingly tragic casualty of the NBA Lottery. Not worth it. Your typical draft bust.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            For all these reasons, I could easily sit here and say, “I told you so.”
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Not so fast.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            To be honest, I can’t say that I followed Fredette’s career as a King very closely. But I understand that his numbers were pretty good – This season, Fredette is shooting 50% on catch-and-shoot three-pointers, according to NBA Stats. And, while using a small sample, Fredette is still a career 40.1% 3-point shooter. These aren’t necessarily “draft bust” numbers. So what was the deal?
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Well, Fredette was known not to get much playing time in Sacramento. You could say that it was because he was a liability on defense, but, arguably, so is Thomas, the man who beat him out of the job at point guard. It stands to reason that, if he was drafted to put butts in seats, he should have at least gotten considerably more playing time – especially for a squad going nowhere, in terms of the postseason. After all, the team has been downright awful for the last eight years, not having reached a record over .500 since 2006, and averaging a paltry 26.7 wins over that time period (minus this season). Why NOT give Fredette all the minutes he could muster, at least, at the two-guard spot? It wasn’t like he was hurting his team’s chances of winning, anyway.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            The answer to that was simple – while he was on the team, there were simply too many men on the floor who needed the ball in their hands. From DeMarcus Cousins to Tyreke Evans to Marcus Thornton to Rudy Gay, Fredette was never going to get the amount of opportunities he needed to prove he could be a consistent, valuable scoring asset to the team. That, and the coaching staffs that dealt with him can’t be charged with utilizing Fredette effectively – otherwise, he’s probably still wearing a purple-and-white uniform.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h1 class="text-center">
            PICTURE OF FREDETTE AS A BULL
        </h1>
        <p class="lead text-center">
            Now a Chicago Bull, Fredette’s lack of success with the Kings can’t be pinned solely on him.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            The bottom line is that Fredette, while still having potential to majorly contribute in the league, was pretty much set up to fail from the beginning. (That’s right – I’m pulling “the Alex Smith Argument“.) He was lauded as a franchise-altering player when he simply didn’t have the skill-set to do so, and came into a franchise environment that was already toxic – a franchise in the middle of a famine, no veteran leadership, and its owners at odds with its host city. You couldn’t expect a Kyrie Irving or a Kawhi Leonard to turn that team around. But Jimmer Fredette? He didn’t stand a chance.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            I suppose that was my point all along. The perception was that Jimmer was going to be a world-changer. I knew he wasn’t – not just because I believed he didn’t have it in him, but that the team was still years away from any kind of success. He wasn’t going to be that guy.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            But he can be a contributor. And now, he has a fresh start with a new team and a new city, with the right expectations. The expectation that he can’t necessarily save a franchise – but contribute to its potential success.
