            The End of Tim Lincecum? An MSR Retrospective

            He may have been one of the greatest pitchers in the history of the San Francisco Giants.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            He’s been called “The Freak”, “The Franchise”, and — yes — even “Big Time Timmy Jim”.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Hell, I’m sure many remember the ESPN SportsCenter commercial about his many nicknames (mostly
            self-proclaimed, but still):

            But, now, with reports that the 31-year-old will likely miss the rest of the 2015 season, due to a setback
            with his troubled hips, many believe that Tim Lincecum had already set foot on the mound as a San Francisco
            Giant for the last time.

        <br>
        <p>
            The Bellevue, Washington native, currently with a 7–4 record and a 4.13 ERA on the season, had been dealing
            with lingering injuries for months, dating back to last postseason. Coupled with a contusion on his pitching
            arm, suffered on June 27 against the Colorado Rockies, Lincecum has been on the DL, hoping to get better for
            the final month of the season.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            The most likely course for Lincecum at this point would be offseason surgery to repair his hip and back
            problems — <a

                he had been futilely trying to seek</a> in order to come back by the end of this season. However, he is
            on the final year of his current two-year deal with the Giants, and the club will most likely allow him to
            test the market in free agency.
