            He may have been one of the greatest pitchers in the history of the San Francisco Giants.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            He’s been called “The Freak”, “The Franchise”, and — yes — even “Big Time Timmy Jim”.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Hell, I’m sure many remember the ESPN SportsCenter commercial about his many nicknames (mostly
            self-proclaimed, but still):

            But, now, with reports that the 31-year-old will likely miss the rest of the 2015 season, due to a setback
            with his troubled hips, many believe that Tim Lincecum had already set foot on the mound as a San Francisco
            Giant for the last time.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            The Bellevue, Washington native, currently with a 7–4 record and a 4.13 ERA on the season, had been dealing
            with lingering injuries for months, dating back to last postseason. Coupled with a contusion on his pitching
            arm, suffered on June 27 against the Colorado Rockies, Lincecum has been on the DL, hoping to get better for
            the final month of the season.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            The most likely course for Lincecum at this point would be offseason surgery to repair his hip and back
            problems — <a

                he had been futilely trying to seek</a> in order to come back by the end of this season. However, he is
            on the final year of his current two-year deal with the Giants, and the club will most likely allow him to
            test the market in free agency.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            It’s not an ending befitting of a pitcher who put the Giants back on the map as a team worth talking about in Major League Baseball, as well as a playoff contender. Known for a 99-mph fastball (in his prime), a wicked change-up and an unorthodox wind-up, Lincecum was a 175-pound anomaly of an athlete, that gained fame in the Bay Area as the wins piled up.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            His freakish talent did not go unnoticed early in his career, despite the lean years in San Francisco that preceded 2010. He won back-to-back Cy Young Awards in 2008 and 2009, going a combined 33–12 in 66 starts, with ERAs under 2.65 (<b>2.62</b> in 2008; <b>2.48</b>> in 2009) and an average of 263 strikeouts. He was the unquestioned ace on a squad that was still learning how to win.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Then, 2010 happened. While he walked away from the regular season without stunning numbers (16–10, 3.43 ERA, 231 strikeouts), he helped the team reach the playoffs — and, in a dominating debut performance in the postseason, Lincecum threw for 14 strikeouts in a 1–0 win over the Atlanta Braves:

            It’s not difficult to forget just how dominant Lincecum was in those years before it all seemed to go downhill. But his performances in his prime were certainly wonders to behold. He was seemingly invincible when he was on his game, and his playoff run with the Giants in 2010 certainly proved that.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Just take a look at what he did in the World Series clincher in Game 5 — after a less-than-stellar Game 1 performance, he came back to throw 8 brilliant innings, allowing one run on 3 hits. It was the pinnacle of his young career.
