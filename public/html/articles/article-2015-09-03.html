            The End of Tim Lincecum? An MSR Retrospective

            He may have been one of the greatest pitchers in the history of the San Francisco Giants.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            He’s been called “The Freak”, “The Franchise”, and — yes — even “Big Time Timmy Jim”.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Hell, I’m sure many remember the ESPN SportsCenter commercial about his many nicknames (mostly
            self-proclaimed, but still):

            I still call him that last one, to this day.
        </p>
        <hr>
        <p>
            But, now, with reports that the 31-year-old will likely miss the rest of the 2015 season, due to a setback
            with his troubled hips, many believe that Tim Lincecum had already set foot on the mound as a San Francisco
            Giant for the last time.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            The Bellevue, Washington native, currently with a 7–4 record and a 4.13 ERA on the season, had been dealing
            with lingering injuries for months, dating back to last postseason. Coupled with a contusion on his pitching
            arm, suffered on June 27 against the Colorado Rockies, Lincecum has been on the DL, hoping to get better for
            the final month of the season.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            The most likely course for Lincecum at this point would be offseason surgery to repair his hip and back
            problems — <a
                href="https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/13568603/tim-lincecum-san-francisco-giants-seeking-another-opinion-hip-injury">something
                he had been futilely trying to seek</a> in order to come back by the end of this season. However, he is
            on the final year of his current two-year deal with the Giants, and the club will most likely allow him to
            test the market in free agency.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            It’s not an ending befitting of a pitcher who put the Giants back on the map as a team worth talking about in Major League Baseball, as well as a playoff contender. Known for a 99-mph fastball (in his prime), a wicked change-up and an unorthodox wind-up, Lincecum was a 175-pound anomaly of an athlete, that gained fame in the Bay Area as the wins piled up.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            His freakish talent did not go unnoticed early in his career, despite the lean years in San Francisco that preceded 2010. He won back-to-back Cy Young Awards in 2008 and 2009, going a combined 33–12 in 66 starts, with ERAs under 2.65 (<b>2.62</b> in 2008; <b>2.48</b>> in 2009) and an average of 263 strikeouts. He was the unquestioned ace on a squad that was still learning how to win.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Then, 2010 happened. While he walked away from the regular season without stunning numbers (16–10, 3.43 ERA, 231 strikeouts), he helped the team reach the playoffs — and, in a dominating debut performance in the postseason, Lincecum threw for 14 strikeouts in a 1–0 win over the Atlanta Braves:

            The beginning (of the end) of Tim Lincecum’s true greatness on the mound.
        </p>
        <hr>
        <p>
            It’s not difficult to forget just how dominant Lincecum was in those years before it all seemed to go downhill. But his performances in his prime were certainly wonders to behold. He was seemingly invincible when he was on his game, and his playoff run with the Giants in 2010 certainly proved that.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Just take a look at what he did in the World Series clincher in Game 5 — after a less-than-stellar Game 1 performance, he came back to throw 8 brilliant innings, allowing one run on 3 hits. It was the pinnacle of his young career.

            ABSOLUTE MONEY.
        </p>
        <hr>
        <br>
        <p>
            In that video, you could almost see how helpless that potent Texas Rangers lineup felt with Lincecum on the mound. Despite the hiccup against Nelson Cruz that allowed their only run of the game, he knew — the entire Bay Area knew — he wasn’t going to give up that lead with a World Series on the line.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            And, so, it was — after 2010, he was never the same as an ace starter for the Giants rotation. Whether it was problems with his mechanics, lingering injuries or a combination of the two, Lincecum couldn’t find that same touch he had in previous years — at least, nothing that he could sustain over a long period of time.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            That didn’t mean he didn’t have his moments. After all, he was integral for the 2012 World Series Champion Giants — as a reliever. Coming out of the bullpen for the first time in his professional career after going 10–15 in the regular season, Lincecum put up performances like these — by the way, never allowing a hit in two Fall Classic appearances:

        <br>
        <p>
            And, even when things looked hopeless for Lincecum in ensuing years — struggling to throw consistently, and to get healthy — he still managed to show flashes of his old self. Granted, they were against an offensively hapless San Diego Padres team — but, nonetheless, he did things he didn’t even accomplish in his prime. In 2013, he threw nearly 150 pitches to get his first-ever no-hitter:

        <hr>
        <br>
        <p>
            Less than a calendar year later, <a href="http://m.mlb.com/news/article/81641272/lincecums-second-no-hitter-did-you-know">he did the same thing</a> — this time at home — becoming the first Giants pitcher in over a century to accomplish the feat of two career no-hitters (Christy Matthewson, 1901 and 1905). He also became only the second pitcher in MLB history — the first being Adrian “Addie” Ross of the Cleveland Naps in 1908 and 1910 against the Chicago White Sox.

        <br>
        <p>
            With all of that put in perspective, it’s difficult to believe that his career in the Orange-and-Black is likely over. As indicated above, he provided a bevy of highlights for a team deprived of a championship for more than half-century, and had a hand in turning it into a modern-day baseball dynasty.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            More than that, this is kind of personal for me, as a Giants fan. The fact was, after a 2002 season that saw the Giants literally innings away from a World Series title — only to see it ripped away by the Anaheim Angels and their gotdanged “Rally Monkey” — it was difficult to watch the team in ensuing years, especially with the BALCO scandal hanging over team messiah Barry Bonds’ head.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Then, came the diminutive fireballer that caught everyone’s eye at AT&T Park. While his quirky release got people’s attention, his nigh-untouchable pitching array, and ensuing Cy Young Awards, kept them watching. He was “The Freak”, and he was one of us — even moreso for us in the Fil-Am community, as he is a fellow Filipino-American.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            So, if this is truly goodbye, then let it be by the tip of the cap, no ill will, and best wishes for an uncertain future. You were the best the Giants ever had once, Tim. That is how we, as Giants fans, will remember you — and no matter where you end up after this season, we won’t forget it.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Thank you, Tim Lincecum, and Good Night.
