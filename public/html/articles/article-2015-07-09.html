            Ah, the power of “What if” – especially in the realm of sports.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            When it comes to the scope of history, the question of “what if” is always an enticing one to ask. After all, many an interesting story comes from the thought of the alternate timeline:
        </p>
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li>
                What if <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Guns_of_the_South">the Confederacy won the Civil War?</a>
            </li>
            <li>
                What if <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-13041326">the Soviet Union won the space race?</a> 
            </li>
            <li>
                What if Gavilo Princip <a href="https://www.cracked.com/article_17298_6-random-coincidences-that-created-modern-world.html">wasn’t chilling at that one cafe</a> on the day he planned to assassinate Archduke Ferdinand?
            </li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <p>
            I mean, even I asked “What if” in the past. (<a href="https://pauloccamacho.wordpress.com/?s=what+if">It’s kind of a thing I do.</a>)
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            From <a href="article-2011-02-07.html">the 49ers drafting Aaron Rodgers in 2005,</a> to <a href="article-2011-04-21.html">Tom Brady going anywhere but the Patriots</a> as the 199th pick in 1999, to the recent harebrained idea of <a href="article-2015-06-27.html">trading DeMarcus Cousins for Kawhi Leonard,</a> I have entertained the thought of these “simply won’t happen” or “could’ve happened” scenarios.
        </p>

            Which brings me to the good ol’ crew down at ESPN’s NFL Live. I guess because it was a slow NFL news day (which is certainly understandable), the guys decided to give this tried and true trope a shot, and even get social media in on the action. However, they managed to open some gaping wounds – both old and certified fresh – in the process, by asking the following:
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            <i>“49ers fans, what one play would you change in 49ers history?”</i>
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            They offered four especially heartbreaking moments that many 49ers fans would probably give their right arm to reverse, if it were up to them. If you are a 49ers fan – especially one of this generation – you probably know at least three of them all too well.
