                    Washington Redskins owner Daniel Snyder (right) and College Gameday host Lee Corso have each made headlines in the realm of insensitivity to Native Americans. Is it really much ado about nothing?

                It is an issue that I, for one, really had to think about, not only because of the implications on its relation to Americana, but its relation to race and racial issues in our society.

            <br>
            <p>
                And to think this started with one NFL owner’s perceived stubbornness.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                There were two somewhat unrelated, but equally response-provoking, events that occurred over the past couple weeks that have put the use of Native Americans in sports up for debate – despite the general public’s unwillingness to engage in one.

                The first occurred earlier this month, when the Native American Nation of Oneida called for the owner of Washington’s NFL franchise, Daniel Snyder, to consider changing the team’s name from its original moniker, the “Redskins.” Continually seen by members of the Oneida as offensive, they pleaded with the NFL owner to communicate with them in hopes to come to an understanding of the team name. In response, Snyder held fast as to keeping the name, believing with all sincerity that it is, and continues to be, a nickname that is meant to honor the Native American people. Said in a recent letter by Snyder to Washington’s fans:

                The second came just this past weekend, when the College Gameday crew came to Clemson University, where the then-No. 3 team in the country would face off against the Florida State Seminoles. At the conclusion of the broadcast, the Gameday crew, joined by actor Bill Murray, gave their game picks of the matchup between the Seminoles and the Tigers.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Analyst Lee Corso, notorious for donning school mascot uniforms as a way of representing his picks, stormed onto the set dressed in full “Native American garb”, complete with Warpaint, a headdress, and a custom Seminole spear. There was limited backlash to Corso’s actions, but were defended and written off as a bunch of Good Ol’ Boys having fun, with no offense intended.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                One (Snyder) insists that the Native American moniker is celebrating Native Americans. The other (Corso) is written off as a bit of harmless postulating.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                To me, neither party gets it.

            <br>
            <p>
                Personally, I’m still trying to understand how the caricature treatment of a racial minority can ever be seen as honoring that racial minority. As I have argued many times before, turning a racial minority into a caricature isn’t shedding light on that minority – it’s turning them into a stereotype. From <a href="article-2012-02-28.html">focusing on Jeremy Lin as an Asian American</a>, to <a href="article-2011-03-18.html">the “Uncle Tom” statements Jalen Rose made</a> a couple years ago, the actions and statements made in those cases are considered offensive, not because it’s some oversensitive response from the PC police, but because those gestures actually mean something – whether or not the general public chooses to acknowledge it.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                The term "Redskins" – no matter the cultural history it has accrued through the football team over the last century – is still considered as an insulting, degrading and racially insensitive term. The Oneida Nation obviously thinks so, and I can only assume they are not alone. To denote a particular race by some dated reference of their skin color is to put them in an insulting light, despite what Dan Snyder and, apparently, a number of Redskins fans say about "honor".
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Put another (if not a less contextual, but still equally valid) way: Would people not have a problem with a sports franchise owner calling his or her team the “Yellowskins,” in honor of the Chinese people? (It makes me cringe just writing that.) I would hope they would.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                And, for anyone who wasn’t offended by the actions of one Lee Corso on Saturday, let’s frame it a different way: Try justifying Corso’s episode in any other context – say, during an actual honorary ceremony for the Seminole Nation. I could only assume that there was no way Corso wouldn’t receive a media firestorm for it. So why get away with it on a Nationally-televised sports program?
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                As a matter of fact, why are these issues of racial name-calling and caricatures not seen in the general public as more of a big deal? After all, one of the main arguments against the name-change for Washington’s football franchise, and a reasoning behind the lack of public outrage at Corso’s actions, is that it simply isn’t a big deal.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Counterarguments by those in the blogosphere, as well as many a random comment on the internets, is for those offended to “lighten up” or “get over it” – they’re just words, and they aren’t coming out of the mouths and bodies of racists. This inevitably leads to the argument that the pendulum has swung to the other side, so to speak, when it comes to society’s treatment of race – it’s too oversensitive, and needs to stop focusing so much on such small things, and focus on things like the government shutdown, Syria, or the latest outrage over the Obama Administration.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Now, wait a second.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                First of all, not only do I believe that those views are absurd, they have nothing to do with the conversation. After all, any argument could be shut down, no matter how important or trivial individuals see them as, by simply dismissing them.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Second, and more importantly, I have also never really understood why we dismiss over-sensitivity to historical issues of race as unimportant. The fact is that the Oneida Nation has a problem with the Redskins name, and there is something to be said for having more sensitivity to the Native American people – especially in the media. Why is sensitivity, to something so SENSITIVE, something that is apparently frowned upon in this society? To me – and at the very least, in this case – cultural sensitivity isn’t a sign of weakness in our society. In fact, it’s a sign of true progress.

                Finally, to answer the question, issues like the Redskins name and the Native American caricature have not been seen as a “big deal” in Americana because it has been so ingrained in it. Sports are partly to blame for this – after all, the caricaturization of the Native American people are seen all over American sport. Whether or not the original intentions of using Native Americans as mascots for sports franchises were noble, the fact remains that they have been marginalized in the media – especially sports media – as an overlooked caricature that has lost its true meaning outside the realm of sports.

                It’s no wonder we, as a whole, don’t see the "Redskins" as a derogatory term, or Corso’s imitation of the Seminole mascot as demeaning. It even explains that, according to reports, a majority of Native Americans don’t seem to have a problem with either incident. It’s because we’ve all been culturally indoctrinated to the fact that Native Americans, in the eyes of Americana, are de facto “Minstrels” meant to symbolize sport, and not the rich history of the Native American people. But, don’t take my word for it – <a href="https://lastrealindians.com/news/2013/10/23/oct-23-2013-espns-red-face-minstrel-show-by-matt-remle">Matt Remle of LastRealIndians.com probably makes a better point</a>, in this case, than I ever could.

                Ultimately, both acts, by both Snyder and Corso, are, I’m sure, not meant to be vicious acts of racism, and they certainly mean no harm or racial insensitivity. That doesn’t mean that they aren’t, and, despite the public’s outcry of over-sensitivity, we need to have an intelligent, open dialogue for all of us to understand that we need not reflect on those that point out racial insensitivity – but the society, and its institutions, that allow remnants of racial insensitivity to continue.
