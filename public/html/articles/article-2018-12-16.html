            Dallas Mavericks rookie SF Luka Doncic has been tearing up the league through 28 games, living up to the immense hype he received before the 2018 Draft. Should the Sacramento Kings — projected to take them at No. 2 overall — be regretting their decision to pass on him for Marvin Bagley III ALREADY?!
        </p>
        <br>
        <hr>
        <br>
        <p>
            The 15–13 Sacramento Kings — no, that is not a typo — play the Dallas Mavericks later today.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            This comes two days after letting a 10-point lead slip away against the defending champion Golden State Warriors.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            And, no, that is not a typo, either.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            The reason this is an intriguing matchup for this shockingly-okay, not-a-garbage-fire-for-once Sactown squad? It’s because who is on the other side of the court, and a question of “what could have been” — rookie sensation Luka Doncic.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Let’s rewind back to June of 2018: the Kings are riding into that year’s NBA Draft with the №2 overall pick, in a year they needed an impact player. Staring them in the face was the possibility of drafting the 19-year-old Wunderkind from Slovenia. All the experts and pundits considered Doncic to be a shoo-in as a top-2 pick. Kings fans from all over were licking their lips at the possibility of a talent like Luka in Royal Purple.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            But then came the reports that the Kings front office were looking elsewhere with their lottery ticket — specifically at talented Duke power forward Marvin Bagley III. Apparently, his combination of size, speed and range — as well as the prospect of a high ceiling, at only 19 years old — intrigued general manager Vlade Divac.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            These reports deeply divided the Sacramento Kings fandom, or “Kingdom,” if you will — one side wanted Doncic to lead the squad into a certain future, while viewing Bagley as superfluous, considering the team’s logjam of big men (Willie Cauley-Stein, Kosta Koufos, Harry Giles, Skal Labissierre); the other thought Doncic would never leave his Euroleague team, Real Madrid, for the perceived dumpster fire in Sacramento, and wanted the safest bet at №2 in Bagley.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            The rest is history: the Kings went with Bagley, while the Hawks traded Doncic’s rights to the Dallas Mavericks in exchange for the №5 overall pick, Oklahoma sharpshooter Trae Young.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Which leads us to tonight. Bagley is out with a bone bruise to his knee suffered in Friday’s loss to Golden State. Meanwhile, Luka is being considered as an early runaway candidate for Rookie of the Year.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            It’s no wonder — through 26 games, Doncic is averaging 32.3 minutes, 17.8 points, 6.8 rebounds and 4.5 assists per game. His time in the EuroLeagues has him looking like a seasoned veteran, and he hasn’t turned 20 yet. His on-court intelligence, vision and touch has already garnered early comparisons to LeBron James. He is far and away the best rookie playing in a stacked 2018 draft class, making a significant impact on the Mavericks’ early success.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Meanwhile, Bagley, while having an impressive season (12.7 PPG, 6.1 RPG, 1.0 BLKPG), isn’t making Doncic fans in Sacramento stop pining for him in the backs of their minds. His recent bone bruise — one that will keep him out for at least two weeks — doesn’t help matters.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            In fact, with every pundit’s swoon and sports commentary singing his praises, Kings fans will likely feel that buyer’s remorse well into the future.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            But, should they?
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Let’s look at it like this: until his injury, Bagley’s PPG and RPG numbers are comparable to Luka’s, seeing the floor considerably less than the Maverick’s rookie (23.1 minutes per game). He’s also seen that production having not started a single contest.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            You can also call the Kings’ “big man logjam” problem a godsend for Bagley — after all, because of the glut of forwards and centers putting up productive numbers for the team, there is much less pressure on the 19-year-old to stand out. That also means head coach Dave Joerger can ease him into a bigger role, in due time. If the Kings truly believe that Bagley will have the higher ceiling, it only serves both parties best to be patient with his development.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            That only makes the thought of a Bagley-Giles-Cauley-Stein frontcourt rotation all the more tantalizing.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Then there’s that one point guard the Kings happen to have. What was his name? Ah, yes — De’Aaron Fox.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h1 class="text-center">
            PICTURE OF DE'AARON FOX
        </h1>
        <p class="lead text-center">
            Sup.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            The statistical jump from the 20-year-old’s rookie season to now has been astronomical. A year ago, Fox averaged 11.6 points, 2.8 rebounds and 4.4 assists per game, in 73 games played. This year, through 28 games, Fox is averaging an eye-popping 18.1 points, 3.6 rebounds and 7.6 assists per game. His game is more efficient, he is the de facto leader on the court, and he has become a go-to guy on a much-improved offense.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            So, consider this — if the Kings had drafted another standout player who needs the ball in his hands all the time in Doncic, is it possible we could have seen this same breakout performance in Fox? You could shrug and say “maybe.” But I would argue, probably not — the reason Doncic’s game is so successful is because he is a primary ball handler. Fox’s surge in play primarily has to do with the fact that HE is the primary ball handler.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Furthermore, consider THIS — much of the Kings’ newfound success on offense has to do with the drastic change in their PACE. Last year, their PACE (possessions adjusted for 48 minutes) was dead last, at 94.9. This year? A ridiculous 11-point improvement, at 103.9 — good for 2nd in the league.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            One could argue that the Kings could have done this with Doncic in the fold. Perhaps. But you also have to look at Dallas’ current PACE with Doncic at the helm, and Dennis Smith Jr. — a player arguably just as fast as De’Aaron Fox — as his running mate: They’re currently at 14th overall, at 99.6. The Mavericks are clearly following Luka’s lead, as they should — but a similar situation in Sacramento may have raised some of the same questions that are already being raised in Dallas.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Ultimately, we’re only 25 games into the regular season. And second-guessing a decision like not taking Luka Doncic in the draft and projecting the success of a Kings team with or without him — one, mind you, that’s one of the youngest in the league — is, at best, premature, and at worst irresponsible.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Personally, I’m happy with the potential the current team has going for them over the next few years. After all, this is the most success the team has seen in over a decade. I say, enjoy the ride while it lasts, and stop second-guessing — because, at the end of the day, every situation is subjective in professional sports, and right now, that situation is actually GOOD for the Sacramento Kings.
