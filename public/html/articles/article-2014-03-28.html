            SDSU's 2014 Run Ends In Sweet 16: Rapid Reaction

            But with a savage defense that was ranked second in the nation in points allowed per game (57.0), and reigning Mountain West Player of the Year in Senior G Xavier Thames, the Aztecs pulled off a MWC regular season title, and an overall 31-5 record.

            SDSU's run ended last night in a hard-fought game aainst the top-seeded Arizona Wildcats. In a rematch of a regular season loss in November, and a game that took a last-minute offensive explosion from G Nick Johnson for Arizona to pull off -- he ended up scoring the team's final 15 points of the game -- San Diego State gave the tournament favorite all they could handle for the first 35 minutes of the contest.
