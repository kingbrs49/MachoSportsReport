                And, so, we’ve come to the midseason for the monstrously disappointing San Francisco 49ers. After two close division wins, the team has rattled off six straight losses, succumbing to defeat in all different ways. Dreams of the postseason have turned into an all-too-real nightmare of dismal offensive football (take the word “offensive” any way you wish). At 2-6, fans and personnel alike are looking for answers, after a promising and hopeful offseason.

                So, what is the problem? After a 2-0 start, one would think things were looking up – then things came crashing down to the grim reality of a bad season. Many pundits, naysayers and fans are throwing in their two cents – some seem to be right, and some are way off. Allow me to shed some light on the subject, by pointing all the fingers:
            </p>
            <p>
                <i>Reason #1: The Offensive Line.</i> The most obvious suspect for the dreadful effectiveness of the 49ers’ offense is their O-Line. They aren’t opening the holes they used to for Gore to make the big gains. At this point in the season, San Francisco has only had a total of 732 rushing yards – ranked 27th in the league. For comparison’s sake, Frank Gore, at this point in the season last year, had a total of 672 yards – by himself. They also aren’t giving either quarterback – Alex Smith nor Trent Dilfer – enough time for him to operate properly. After 8 games, the line has allowed a total of 28 sacks, ranked 30th in the league. At least the Niners can point to injuries now, with significant setbacks to starting linemen Justin Smiley and Jonas Jennings. But, at the beginning of the season, the offensive line’s struggles were inexplicable. It’s as if the line forgot how to block in the offseason.

                <figcaption class="figure-caption ml-4" style="width:250px">
                    49ers coach Jim Hostler has struggled in his first year as Offensive Coordinator, leaving the offense as one of the worst in the league.
                </figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>
                <i>Reason #2: Offensive Coordinator Jim Hostler.</i> Hostler controls the offense. The offense stinks. Therefore, you must point to Hostler, right? I wish I could say “not necessarily”. But, after watching this team for 8 games, I simply cannot do it. This is Hostler’s first stint as Offensive Coordinator, and the offense’s transition from wunderkind OC Norv Turner to Hostler has been anything but smooth. Many 49ers fans were worried when Turner left for the San Diego Chargers’ head coaching job, and they had every reason to, as things stand now.
            </p>
            <p>
                The offense looks confused out there, and it is easy to point at Hostler for their shortcomings. As it stands, after eight games, the 49ers offense is dead-last in total yards (1,794) and passing yards (1,062). They are also 31st in the league in points (104), ahead of only the 0-8 St. Louis Rams, with only 99 points through eight games. Hostler can also be seen as imbalanced in his play-calling – when a team is too heavy on either run or pass plays, the team usually struggles. As it stands, the 49ers are dead-last in rushing attempts (173). Blame it on falling behind early all you want, but ball control is key in an offensive attack – and a balanced attack, complete with a steady amount of run plays, is key to ball control. An average of less than 22 carries per game does not equate to a balanced offensive attack. An ineffective passing attack, the virtual absence of an effective rushing attack, coupled with the struggles of the offensive line, has led many to believe that the 49ers are a team without a concrete offensive identity.

            <p>
                Ultimately, the absence of Turner – and the presence of Hostler – hurts the most in the regression of quarterback Alex Smith. In Smith’s second year, under Turner, his statistics, pocket presence and touchdown-to-interception ratio were vastly improved. Many were hoping Smith would continue to improve, even with his third offensive coordinator in three years. Hostler hasn’t helped him do that. In fact, some could say he has truly regressed Smith’s progress, with his lack of efficient play-calling on offense. This leads me to —
            </p>
            <p>
                <i>Reason #3: Alex Smith.</i> Having said all that, some of the blame must fall on Smith. Despite the different offenses and personnel he has had to adapt to in three years as starting quarterback, Smith simply hasn’t shown any semblance of offensive brilliance. At the end of the day, there is no special talent there – no one can point to any significant strength (besides his intelligence, which, suffice it to say, hasn’t helped that much in his physical game) that he possesses. He’s been surrounded by offensive weapons like Vernon Davis, Frank Gore and Darrell Jackson, and hasn’t been able to show much. Having played 6 of 8 games this season due to a shoulder injury, Smith has thrown for 800 yards and only 2 touchdowns, to 4 interceptions, and a 49.7 completion percentage. Injuries, and lack of help from the rest of the offense hasn’t helped him, but with the 49ers in need of a talented – or, at least, a competent – field general, Smith just hasn’t panned out. As much as I hate to say it, I think it’s safe to say that Alex Smith is pretty much a bust.

                On the bright side, their defense has much improved from seasons past. Two seasons ago, their defense was dead-last in points and yards allowed. This season, the defensive attack has grown stronger, with the acquisitions of shutdown corner Nate Clements, hard-hitting safety Michael Lewis and Rookie of the Year candidate Patrick Willis, who currently leads the league in tackles, with 83. Although they are 20th in the league in points allowed, and 19th in yards allowed, they are 3rd in the league in sacks (28), tied for first in forced fumbles (14), and tied for eighth in passes defended (41). If the defense looks like they are struggling defensively, blame it on the offense – the 49ers’ average time of possession is 26:41 – nearly 6-and-a-half minutes less than their opponents. Too many three-and-outs and stalled offensive drives will lead to a fatigued defensive team.

                In the end, the 49ers look like they have regressed back to their 2004 state – dead-last in offense, and no significant hope of improvement. Even with an improved defense, San Francisco’s offensive woes may be too much to overcome. And, worse yet, the 49ers can’t even look forward to a top-10 pick in next year’s NFL draft: they traded their 2008 first-round pick to the New England Patriots for the rights to offensive tackle Joe Staley. With all of the pieces the 49ers still need to fit into their playoff puzzle, the loss of the pick is significant.

                Strap in for the rest of the season, 49ers fans – judging by the first eight games, it’s going to be a long one.
