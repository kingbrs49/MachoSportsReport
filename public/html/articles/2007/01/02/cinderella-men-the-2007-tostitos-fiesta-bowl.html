                    The Boise State Broncos (13-0) shocked the college football world by defeating the Oklahoma Sooners (11-3) in one of the most exciting Fiesta Bowls ever played.

                It was a game you had to see to believe. It was one of those games where you would call up your friends and ask, “Did you see that game?!!” It was arguably one of the best, most exciting Fiesta Bowls ever played, and it couldn’t have ended any other way. In the end, it was a game that seemed only possible in storybooks.
            </p>
            <p>
                In another game that screamed for a National college football playoff, the ninth-ranked underdog Boise State Broncos defeated the heavy favorite, the seventh-ranked Oklahoma Sooners. In a game that can only be described as an instant classic, a surprising early game offensive explosion and gutsy plays at the end of the game by Boise State head coach Chris Petersen pulled out a breathtaking overtime victory, 43-42.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Boise State Broncos came into the Fiesta Bowl, finishing their best season in recent memory – a 12-0 record, going undefeated in the WAC. They beat their opponents by an average of 23.8 points per game, and scored 35 or more points in 10 of their 12 regular season games. Despite all that, many experts believed that Oklahoma, the champions of the Big 12, would pound Boise State with their hard-hitting defense and talented RB Adrian Peterson. Despite a “disappointing” 11-2 season, by their standards, the Sooners were considered heavy favorites against a Boise State team that hadn’t played a quality team all season. They were expected to win the Fiesta Bowl in a rout.

            <p>
                Apparently, someone didn’t tell Boise State. Led by the poise of QB Jared Zabransky and the playmaking of RB Ian Johnson, the underdog Broncos came out in the opening drive with a fire only a team with something to prove can have. Zabransky began the game with a dynamic 49-yard touchdown strike to Drisan James, to take an early 7-0 lead. With a Paul Johnson fumble at their own 9-yard line, Oklahoma gave the ball, as well as the momentum, back to Boise State. After Mike T. Williams recovered for Boise State, an Ian Johnson touchdown run gave the Broncos a 14-0 lead, and the unforeseen possibility of a Boise State rout.

            <p>
                Oklahoma’s defense tightened up, however, and didn’t allow another score for the next 20 minutes. A touchdown pass from Oklahoma QB Paul Thompson to Manuel Johnson and a Garrett Hartley field goal cut the Boise State lead to 14-10. Key runs by tailbacks Allen Patrick and Adrian Peterson set up the Sooner scoring drives. The Broncos answered back with another scoring strike to Drisan James, this one for 32 yards, extending the lead, 21-10 at the half.

                    Oklahoma star RB Adrian Peterson did all he could in the Fiesta Bowl loss, racking up 77 yards and 2 TDs on 20 carries.

                In the third quarter, Boise State and Oklahoma traded touchdowns – the Broncos struck first, with a key interception return for a touchdown by Marty Tadman. Adrian Peterson struck back with an 8-yard touchdown run of his own. With the score 28-17 in favor of the Broncos, the Sooners were in desperate need of big plays. In the fourth quarter, A Hartley field goal pulled the Sooners within a possession, at 20-28. The game fell into the hands of QB Paul Thompson, and, in the final minutes, he and CB Marcus Walker provided those much needed plays.
            </p>
            <p>
                With drives by both teams dying at midfield, Oklahoma was still in the game. As the Boise State fans were getting closer to a monumental upset, Oklahoma kept their composure. Thompson was forced to make something happen, with time running out on their season. With 2:27 left in the fourth quarter, Thompson made the plays necessary to drive the ball down from their own 23-yard line. He needed only 1:25 to single-handedly get the Sooners the touchdown they needed to stay in the game. After a TD pass to Quentin Chaney, a two-point conversion was critical. Both teams were called on penalties in two attempts, giving the Sooners their third, and final, shot. Thompson made the most of it: on a strike to Juaquin Iglesias, the Sooners were back in the game, tied at 28.

                Boise State’s storybook finish was beginning to look grim after the Oklahoma comeback. Things turned from bad to worse on the ensuing possession by the Broncos – after a relatively error-free game, Jared Zabransky potentially made one of the worst of his college career. Marcus Walker stepped into a pass thrown way off course, and returned it untouched for the go-ahead score, 35-28. It was there that Boise State’s upset hopes were crushed: with :58 left on the clock, they would need a miracle to drive down the field and score. Little did everyone know, head coach Chris Petersen pulled out his bag of tricks.

                On the ensuing kickoff, Zabransky and the Broncos looked like their days were numbered. That is, until they pulled off a perfectly-executed hook-and-lateral play with 0:07 left on the clock, for an improbable touchdown. No one could believe what they saw – especially the Sooners. It was a storybook finish in regulation for the Broncos, and, with the game tied at 35, this epic Fiesta Bowl was headed into overtime.

                Oklahoma struck first, with a quick 25-yard strike by Adrian Peterson, to make it 42-35. With their backs against the wall, Zabransky, Johnson and the Broncos showed their championship heart with two of the most amazing plays in Bowl history. On 4th-and-2, with the Fiesta Bowl on the line, Coach Petersen called an oldie but goodie. An old-fashioned option play fooled the entire Oklahoma defense, with a touchdown pass from Vinny Perretta to Derek Shouman. Exhausted, trailing by 1, and one last shot at happily ever ever in sight, Coach Petersen decided to go for the two-point conversion, and win it right then and there. With three wideouts lined up on the right side, everyone assumed Zabransky would try a lob to the end zone – that included the Oklahoma defense.

                That is when Ian Thompson made the offensive play of his life.

                Selling the pass perfectly, Zabransky pump faked to the right with the ball behind his back, in his other hand. Thompson took the ball and ran left, completely untouched, winning the game 43-42. The story of the Broncos was complete. They had, against all odds, won the Fiesta Bowl, proving, at 13-0, they belonged with the best teams in the country.

                The Boise State Broncos may have pulled off one of the most improbable, amazing victories in Fiesta Bowl history, closing the book on a memorable season. But, with Boise State’s bag of tricks exhausted, Ian Johnson had one more up his sleeve.
            </p>
            <p>
                After the game, Johnson was in the middle of a post-game interview, celebrating the Broncos’ thrilling victory. It was then, where he took the opportunity to seize the moment, in a different way. He proposed to his girlfriend, Boise State’s head cheerleader Chrissy Popadics, in front of thousands of people.

            <p>
                She said yes, and leapt into his arms.

            <p>
                Now, that’s a storybook ending.
