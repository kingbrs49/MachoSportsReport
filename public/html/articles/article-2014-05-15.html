            Kings Kawhi & Damian?: An MSR "What If"
        </h1>
        <br>
        <hr>
        <br>
        <p>
            So, the NFL Draft is over and done with. How about a little NBA Draft talk?
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            The NBA Draft Lottery is just a week away. And with the league’s worst teams hoping to succeed in grabbing a coveted top-3 lottery pick (where they failed in winning games for the majority of the previous regular season), hope always springs eternal.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            And, despite the problems it has been accused of causing – from <a href="http://www.libertyballers.com/2014/3/4/5459688/the-nbas-tanking-problem">the “tanking” phenomenon</a> to … well … <a href="http://insider.espn.go.com/nba/story/_/id/10779732/tank-rank-season-biggest-losers">the “tanking” phenomenon</a> – it does allow a somewhat egalitarian solution for distributing the best incoming amateur–err, I mean, draft prospects.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Though, having a lousy NBA record – or even the worst – doesn’t always mean a lottery boon. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009_NBA_draft">Just ask the 2008 Sacramento Kings.</a>
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            And, even if you land a high draft pick, that doesn’t mean the player you draft will pan out to be an All-Star caliber talent. <a href="article-2014-03-06.html">Just ask the Sacramento Kings.</a>

        <p class="lead text-center">
            Here’s a trivia question: Can you name all of these players taken as lottery picks by the Kings?
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            But seriously – this isn’t a new phenomenon. After all, look to the Portland Trail Blazers as one of the most snake-bitten franchises in NBA history when it comes to top picks. Taking Kentucky C Sam Bowie with the No. 2 overall pick over <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7v_6GzDO20">a certain guard from the University of North Carolina in 1984</a> has gone down in NBA Draft infamy. Then, it happened to them again in 2007, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_NBA_draft">taking Ohio State C Greg Oden</a> over Texas SF/PF Kevin Durant with the top overall pick.

            Hey, man. Why you gotta bring that up again?
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Nevertheless, it was something I happened to notice over some recent NBA drafts. The Sacramento Kings, who had drafted fairly well in the early-to-mid-2000s during the team’s heyday of success, had whiffed on a couple of lottery picks that, I believe, the organization should have seen coming. And, had they chosen correctly when they had the chance, Sacramento would not be struggling as much as they are now.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Sure, hindsight is 20/20. However, I still contend that two particular lottery picks that the Kings took a chance on – BYU PG/SG Jimmer Fredette and Kansas PF Thomas Robinson – were gargantuan mistakes, considering who was still on the board. I can make the argument that, had the 2011 NBA Draft had gone the way I – and a few other NBA pundits – thought it should have gone for Sacramento, the situation I am about to pose would have easily been feasible for the Kings. So, indulge me as I rewind back to the year 2011:
        </p>
        <br>
        <p class="kings">
            <b>Revisionist Event #1: <i>With the 7th pick in the 2011 NBA Draft, the Sacramento Kings select … Kawhi Leonard, Small Forward, San Diego State.</i></b>
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            As people who are well-versed in my blog very well know, I was a proponent of the Kings taking a player I was highly familiar with coming out of college. What was so frustrating about this was that Leonard was considered for the pick, and worked out with the team. Some pundits even projected Leonard to fall to Sacramento. Even more frustrating, he did – TWICE. And, both times, the Kings passed on him.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            I had watched him play while I attended SDSU for graduate school, and he was a double-double machine – a certified man-child who, given a couple years, could become a mainstay at the forward position. And with a diminished frontcourt that only featured marquis C DeMarcus Cousins, I thought he would have filled a need, and have been a great fit with the team. Not necessarily a flashy player, but, hey, neither was Tim Duncan.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            In this scenario, the muddled trade nonsense for John Salmons would have been completely unnecessary, and resident PG Beno Udrih would have stayed in the Kings’ fold for at least one more season. He would have likely started right away for a Kings team in need of a hard-nosed rebounder that could have helped Cousins keep from being double-teamed all the time. He could have grown as a player in the same vein as a Chris Webber, and someone I’m sure the fans would have embraced, as a California kid who grew up only six hours away in Riverside, California.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Whether they could have still obtained the same pick they had in 2012 is probably unlikely, but let’s just assume that, despite Leonard’s production, they could have still finished with a record worthy of a 5th overall pick.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p class="kings">
            <b>Revisionist Event #2: <i>With the 5th pick in the 2012 NBA Draft, the Sacramento Kings select … Damian Lillard, point guard, Weber State.</i></b>
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            What’s really infuriating about this was that, despite being right there for the Kings to take, and instead, they went with Robinson. Who was selected ONE PICK LATER?
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            However, what’s important to remember here is that, for this to have even been considered by the Kings brass (had they been smart enough to do so), Leonard had to have been drafted the year before, instead of Fredette. In any case, a PG would most likely have been a main concern for the franchise, and Lillard would have likely been the favorite for the Kings to take there.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Now imagine a trio of Cousins, Kawhi Leonard and Damian Lillard heading into the 2013 season.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            I think it would be easy to think that the Kings could have at least been a little better off this offseason than they are in their current state.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Now, I’ll admit that it still stings when I see Kawhi doing things like this for a championship-caliber team like the Spurs:
