            It’s that time of year, again. It’s a time for LOVE.

        <p>
            That’s right – today is Valentine’s Day. With that in mind, let us cast aside all of the lovey-dovey stereotypes and cynicism of the holiday itself, and focus on what’s really important: sports.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            In the spirit of the occasion, allow me to fawn over the most current things I love, and have come to love, for Valentines Day:

            <b><i>San Diego State Men's Basketball.</i></b>> Remember the Aztecs team that went 34-3, who ultimately took down the Jimmer and BYU in the MWC Tournament, and reached the Sweet 16, only to lose to eventual NCAA champ Connecticut? A lot of people thought that they had probably reached their peak, what with sophomore F Kawhi Leonard, along with four seniors, departing in 2011. Well, all thoughts of their downfall were greatly exaggerated. Thanks to good recruiting and the stability of head coach Steve Fisher, the Aztecs of 2011-2012 bolted to an 18-2 start, including an exciting win over then #12 UNLV.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Their impressive backcourt of Chase Tapley and Jamaal Franklin have picked up the scoring slack, combining for 32.2 points per game, and a team defense that has come up big for them in conference play. Currently at 20-4, only one loss came against an unranked squad (Colorado State), and if they continue a good showing, heading into the MWC tournament, they may wind up with a top-8 seed in the NCAAs. I have to show love to one of my alma maters – especially since they are doing so well after losing all five of their starters from last season.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Then there’s G Tim Shelton’s viral sensation “Aztec Motto”, which, personally, I love:

            <b><i>49ers head coach Jim Harbaugh.</i></b> Despite heaping some of the blame on him for the NFC Championship game loss last month, it would take something huge for me to lose my love for the man that almost single-handedly turned the franchise around, after eight consecutive seasons of going .500 and under. After leaving Stanford last January for the friendly confines of Candlestick, he didn’t exactly get off to a great start: He declared incumbent QB Alex Smith as his starter, and drafted unheralded Missouri DE Aldon Smith with the 7th overall pick in the NFL Draft.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Fast-forward to the end of 2011. Jim Harbaugh leads the 49ers to a 13-3 record and the #2 seed in the NFC playoffs, turns Alex Smith into a clutch QB – something most 49ers fans believed would never happen – and had one of the best defenses in the league. His expertise, as well as his sheer enthusiasm and pure belief in the team, perpetuated a winning atmosphere the 49ers hadn’t had in almost a decade, and it eventually led them to the NFC championship game. Bless you, Jim Harbaugh, for coming to San Francisco.

            <b><i>Knicks PG Jeremy Lin.</i></b> Everyone loves an underdog story. Unless, depending on who you are, that underdog rhymes with “Grim Knee Row” – but I digress. PG Jeremy Lin seemingly came out of nowhere – and when I say “nowhere,” I mean “the NBDL” – to light up the league like no unheralded NBA player has in years. It isn’t hard to love this kid’s story, his recent success, and his humility through it all. It wasn’t long ago that Lin, a Harvard grad, was sleeping on his brother’s couch before he got news that he would be picked up by New York – mostly as a bench-warmer.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h1 class="text-center">

        <p class="lead text-center">
            "Thanks, Bro!"
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            After getting the starting PG slot when incumbent Chauncey Billups went down, Lin has galvanized a squad missing its two other superstars (Amare Stoudemire and Carmelo Anthony) to a 5-0 record, averaging 26.8 points per game, and setting records for most points in his first four NBA starts (114). With phrases like “All he does is Lin”, “Lin-sanity” and “Lin-possible is Nothing” cropping up like weeds, it literally took only days for the sporting world to become enthralled with Jeremy Lin. His out-of-nowhere success, his faith, and his story is why I love this guy. The fact that he is an Asian-American is rarely seen in a sport like professional basketball, and, no doubt, brings a sense of pride to the Asian-American community at large. I love it, and I hope to see his success continue.

            <b><i>Boxer Manny Pacquiao.</i></b> Despite a fairly controversial decision against his arch-nemesis Juan-Manuel Marquez, Manny Pacquiao remains one of the best boxers in the world. It shouldn’t be too much of a surprise why I have this man’s back – he represents a source of pride to the Fil-Am community, and he gives back to his native Philippines whenever he can (like a good successful Filipino should).
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Despite <a href="http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1030845-mayweather-vs-pacquiao-a-history-of-boxings-biggest-feud">his media feud with the undefeated Floyd Mayweather, Jr.,</a> and the constant doubt about an eventual superfight between the two boxers, Pacquiao is moving forward with a June 9 bout with Junior Welterweight champ Timothy Bradley. And, while Bradley poses, according to experts, <a href="http://espn.go.com/boxing/story/_/id/7547798/manny-pacquiao-agrees-terms-fight-timothy-bradley-jr">a real threat to Pacquiao’s fighting style,</a> I don’t doubt that he will have the ability to put him down like the scores of fighters before him.

            <b><i>Tennis Star Novac Djokovic.</i></b> It’s hard not to back the guy – after the reign of Federer and Nadal, “the Djoker” swooped in and asserted his dominance of the sport in the span of only a couple of years. Now, he finds himself still atop the tennis world, and after two five-set marathon matches to win the Australian Open against Andy Murray and Rafael Nadal, he has definitely earned it.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            If there’s one thing I didn’t like, it was the aftermath of his title match, involving his shirt, a 14-year-old girl, and an alleged “shirt thief”, and the ensuing dust-up that occurred. But, other than that, Djokovic should have a championship run that matches, if not surpasses, those of his Swiss and Spanish predecessors.

            <b><i>Women's Soccer Forward Alex Morgan.</i></b> Many Women’s World Cup fans from this past summer may know the big names from the US team – Abby Wambach, Megan Rapinoe, and Hope Solo, to name a few. But it was 22-year-old Alex Morgan who scored some of the biggest goals in the tournament. After their thrilling quarterfinal match against Brazil, for which Wambach “saved the USA’s life” to send it to an unbelievable PK victory, it was the relatively unknown Morgan who scored in the ensuing semifinal vs. France, and was involved in both of the US team’s goals in the final vs. Japan – scoring on one and assisting on the other.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Now, the youngest player on the US Women’s World Cup squad has gained a bit of a following, and after scoring two goals against New Zealand in an international friendly in Dallas this past weekend, she has definitely caught my attention. Then again, it isn’t difficult to notice a beauty such as she – especially after she reportedly will appear in Sports Illustrated’s annual swimsuit issue.

            <b><i>Giants Closer Brian Wilson.</i></b> My love for this man probably doesn’t even need an explanation. His epic-ness is all the explanation I really need.  That, or his beard, which has become a pop culture phenomenon.

        <br>
        <p>
            But, the pitcher for the 2010 World Champion San Francisco Giants is more than his antics. Despite his struggles with injury this past year, he is still one of the most feared closers in the league, and armed with a ridiculous fastball and a near-unshakeable will to win, he should be able to come back and establish his dominance over opposing batters again in 2012.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            In the meantime, enjoy this epic awesomeness.

            <i>Ah, Beadle. I have loved you since the first time I saw you on “SportsNation.” I try to catch it as much as I can, and I love the fact that you are unapologetic about your sports opinions. I listen to your Podcast all the time. And you are one of the hottest ladies I have ever seen.</i>

            On a serious note, I really am a huge fan of Michelle Beadle. I realize I’m not alone on this, but I thought that, at least, on this Valentines Day, I would allow myself to express that here.
