            In honor of the superstitious – one we will actually see twice more this calendar year (March 13 and November 13) – allow me to run down the 13 most unfortunate sports stories that matter to me, and hopefully, matter to you. Let’s get started:

            It hasn’t been the best of times for the San Francisco 49ers. Between the unexpected end of incumbent head coach Jim Harbaugh’s decorated tenure (three NFC Championship appearances, one Super Bowl appearance), the head-scratching promotion of former defensive line coach Jim Tomsula and the complete overhaul of the team’s coaching staff, all is not well in the City by the Bay.

            The backlash from the fan base – particularly against GM Trent Baalke and owner Jed York – has been vocal and vitriolic, to say the least. Cries of “The sky is falling” have been rampant among the 49er Faithful, and it’s not for nothing – after all, when the new defensive coordinator used to be an “offensive consultant” for the team, and the new offensive coordinator oversaw Colin Kaepernick’s rapid decline at QB, many see the writing on the wall – and it likely says “under .500”.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            For their sakes, I hope this staff pulls through, but right now, it doesn’t look promising.

            As if the coaching staff in flux wasn’t bad enough for 49ers fans, the team’s former head coach said in a recent interview that, despite initial reports that the parting of ways between Harbaugh and the team were “mutual”, he didn’t want to leave the Red-and-Gold:
        </p>
        <br>
        <blockquote class="blockquote text-center">
            <p class="mb-0">
                <i>I was told I wouldn’t be the coach any more. And then . . . you can call it ‘mutual,’ I mean, I wasn’t going to put the 49ers in the position to have a coach that they didn’t want any more. But that’s the truth of it.  I didn’t leave the 49ers.  I felt like the 49er hierarchy left me.</i>

            They wanted to sign their prized free agent 3B Pablo Sandoval to a long-term contract … and he decided to go to Boston.

            They went after prized free agent SP Jon Lester with the money Sandoval left on the bargaining table … and he decided to go to the Cubbies.

            They went after a litany of free agent hitters and pitchers, including Melky Cabrera, James Shields, Yasmani Tomas and Chase Headley … and all opted for other options.

            They tried trading for guys like Nick Markakis and Justin Upton … but the only trade they could pull off was for Marlins 3B Casey McGehee.

            Coupled with the loss of Michael Morse and the addition of former Kansas City Royals LF Nori Aoki, the Giants’ offseason <a href="https://www.sfgate.com/giants/article/Why-the-SF-Giants-have-been-so-quiet-this-6025534.php">hasn’t blown anyone away, by any reasonable measure.</a> And this was a team that just won the World Series.

            Maybe the thought of the odd-year postseason drought kept guys away like the Plague.

            Super Bowl XLIX was theirs for the taking. They could have been defending champs. With 20 seconds left at the Patriots 1-yard line, all they needed was one play, and the Seattle Seahawks would bring a second straight Lombardi Trophy back to the Pacific Northwest (much to the chagrin of 49ers fans and haters of the Legion of Boom, alike). Then, instead of doing the smart thing and give the ball to RB Marshawn Lynch … this happened:

            Aaaand … Whoops.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Sure, the pass could’ve fell incomplete, and they could have ran it on second-and-goal. But it’s hard not to call the play – and head coach Pete Carroll’s gall to run it – bad luck for the Seahawks.

            Speaking of that ill-timed pass, some of the same superstitionists that believe in Friday the 13th would probably point to another particular sports curse for the ill-fated pass play that ultimately doomed the Seahawks’ chances of repeating:
