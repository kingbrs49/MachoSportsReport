            In honor of the superstitious – one we will actually see twice more this calendar year (March 13 and November 13) – allow me to run down the 13 most unfortunate sports stories that matter to me, and hopefully, matter to you. Let’s get started:

            It hasn’t been the best of times for the San Francisco 49ers. Between the unexpected end of incumbent head coach Jim Harbaugh’s decorated tenure (three NFC Championship appearances, one Super Bowl appearance), the head-scratching promotion of former defensive line coach Jim Tomsula and the complete overhaul of the team’s coaching staff, all is not well in the City by the Bay.

        <p class="lead text-center">Jim Tomsula was interim head coach in 2010. He is now pegged as head coach for 2015 and beyond.</p>

            The backlash from the fan base – particularly against GM Trent Baalke and owner Jed York – has been vocal and vitriolic, to say the least. Cries of “The sky is falling” have been rampant among the 49er Faithful, and it’s not for nothing – after all, when the new defensive coordinator used to be an “offensive consultant” for the team, and the new offensive coordinator oversaw Colin Kaepernick’s rapid decline at QB, many see the writing on the wall – and it likely says “under .500”.

            For their sakes, I hope this staff pulls through, but right now, it doesn’t look promising.

            As if the coaching staff in flux wasn’t bad enough for 49ers fans, the team’s former head coach said in a recent interview that, despite initial reports that the parting of ways between Harbaugh and the team were “mutual”, he didn’t want to leave the Red-and-Gold:
