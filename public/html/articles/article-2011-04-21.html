                The NFL Draft & "The Brady 6": An MSR "What If"

                The NFL draft is coming up in a week, and the pundits have been sniping back and forth for months about who should be taken where, who would fit where, and who would be surefire locks to start, and excel, at the next level. The truth is, however, drafting a player to the pros is a tricky, often unpredictable business. In that case, it is rather easy to forget where some of the greatest athletes in history have come from.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Many describe drafting the right player as an inexact science, and the NFL Draft is probably the epitome of that statement. While Hall of Famers like Dan Marino, John Elway and Walter Payton were drafted high in the first round, other top-5 picks – like QBs Akili Smith and Ryan Leaf, and OL Tony Mandarich – ended up as busts. Joe Montana is perhaps one of the greatest quarterbacks to ever put on a uniform, and a legend in the city of San Francisco. But, when he was drafted in 1979, he didn’t go first overall. He wasn’t even drafted in the first round. When the 49ers came upon the Notre Dame QB, he ended up as the 82nd overall pick, taken in the third round.

                But one man has taken the “Diamond in the Rough” analogy of the NFL Draft and turned it on its ear. Football fans in New England, and those who pay attention to NFL draft coverage, probably know who I’m talking about. He is one Thomas Edward Patrick Brady, Jr. Most know him as three-time Super Bowl Champion, and two-time NFL MVP, Tom Brady.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                In an ESPN special chronicling “The Year of the QB”, Brady was featured as the ultimate NFL draft sleeper – no one picked as low as he was in 2000, or in any other draft, has racked up as many accolades or won as many games as Brady. Meanwhile, the six quarterbacks taken ahead of them – Chad Pennington (New York Jets), Giovanni Carmazzi (San Francisco 49ers), Chris Redman (Baltimore Ravens), Tee Martin (Pittsburgh Steelers), Marc Bulger (New Orleans Saints) and Spergon Wynn (Cleveland Browns) – have either faded to obscurity, or had markedly mediocre careers.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                After a fairly impressive career at the University of Michigan, where he was locked in a constant battle with incumbent QB starter Drew Henson, he had a subpar showing at the NFL Combine in 2000. Despite being overlooked by many, Brady still believed he was good enough to make a name for himself in the NFL. Unfortunately – or fortunately – for him, he had to wait two days, and 198 picks, to see a team who believed that, as well. After watching six quarterbacks taken ahead of him, and after beginning to doubt if he would even be drafted, he heard his name called by the New England Patriots. In the 6th round. At Pick #199.
            </p>

                He started his career not as the backup, but as the fourth QB on the depth chart – which was odd, as final rosters usually only carry three QBs into the regular season. He sat behind incumbent starter Drew Bledsoe, and backup QBs John Friesz and Michael Bishop to begin the 2000 season. However, his motivation as pick #199, and as the 4th-string QB, won him the #2 backup QB spot by season’s end. When Bledsoe was injured early in the 2001 season, Brady was given his opportunity.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                The rest, as they say, is history.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                But, it seems that many sports pundits, historians and fans love to play revisionist history. The old question of “What if” – it’s something we, as sports fans, are fascinated with. For example, in light of the Green Bay Packers’ Super Bowl run, many pondered aloud what could have been if the 49ers took Rodgers with the #1 overall pick. While many believed that the 49ers are collectively kicking themselves for not taking Rodgers over Alex Smith, I abruptly begged to differ. So, you can probably guess where I’m about to go with this.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Like I said earlier, the NFL Draft is an inexact science. Not only from the fact that one never knows who exactly a team is getting when they draft high or low, but also because the player chosen will be entering a completely unique situation. No one can know for sure that, if one player goes to one team or another, that player will be exactly the same, and perform in the exact same manner.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Take Tom Brady – it was obvious, from watching the documentary, that he was greatly affected by the monumental drop he felt he had in the 2000 draft. After all, no one who watched it can forget when he teared up about being drafted:
            </p>
            <hr>
            <div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9">
                <iframe class="embed-responsive-item" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vGF4l3hcgBg" frameborder="0"
                    allowfullscreen></iframe>
            </div>
            <hr>
            <p>
                Of course it was an emotional moment for him – and a watershed one, as it, no doubt, shaped the competitor he turned out to be in New England. Once again, he was taken at pick #199 – a compensatory pick – while every single NFL team had passed up on taking him at least five times. For a signal-caller with as big of a heart as Brady’s, looking to prove himself, that must have stuck in his craw coming up in the league. If he was taken earlier – say, at #18 to the New York Jets, #65 to the San Francisco 49ers, or #75 to the Baltimore Ravens – that deep motivation is thrown right out the window.
            </p>
            <br>

                    This might be a regular occurrence for Brady … if he played anywhere else.

            <hr>
            <p>
                Then, there was the Patriots organization, and the circumstances that gave way to Brady’s ultimate rise. Brady was penciled in as the fourth-string QB, despite the fact that it was unconventional to keep more than three QBs on a regular roster. Despite the setback – or, again, perhaps because of it – Brady was more determined than ever to prove himself, going so far as to boast to fellow Michigan alum Aaron Shea that, when he was given the chance, he was going to beat out Drew Bledsoe for the starting job. Lo and behold, he proved his own statements correct when he got the chance.

                But, remember: it was a chance he got only when Bledsoe went down in 2001, and because he wasn’t the fourth-string QB – he was a solidified number-2 backup. If Bledsoe doesn’t go down, who knows where Brady is now – it may not even be with the Patriots.

                My point is this: great success – especially in the grace-under-fire pressure of professional sports like the NFL – comes from a perfect marriage of talent and circumstance. The player can make the team’s success, but it’s more often a two-way street, in that the team can make the player’s success. While it could be argued that teams like the Ravens, the 49ers and the Steelers missed out on a hidden gem like Brady, it could also be argued that, under the respective teams’ circumstances, Brady might not have flourished as well as he eventually did on the Patriots.

                We can play the “What if” game all we want – but, in Tom Brady’s case, there’s no point. The real point is, Tom Brady is with the Patriots, and together, they ended up being the perfect match.
