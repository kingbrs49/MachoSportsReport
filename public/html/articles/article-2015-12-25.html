            Merry Christmas, everybody!
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            It’s the time of year to be with your loved ones, be merry, and (hopefully) receive the things you’ve hoped
            for all year.

            The same can go for sports fans — after all, the nature of sports has been known to giveth and taketh away.
            For Bay Area sports fans like myself, for example: for every San Francisco Giants dynasty or Golden State
            Warriors championship, you get a “dumpster fire” San Francisco 49ers franchise, or a Sacramento Kings team
            that can’t play a lick of defense. No sports fan’s experience is perfect.

            So, with the imperfect sports fan experience, comes the wish lists that they hope come true for them. If
            Santa could hear their pleas and grant them in the world of sports, I’m sure they would appreciate it. I
            would be one of those people.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            With that said, here’s my personal sports-themed Christmas wish list for 2015:
        </p>
        <br>
        <hr>
        <br>
        <p>
            <b><i>1. The 49ers to change their regime — and replace it with people who can ACTUALLY TURN THINGS
                    AROUND.</i></b>
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            I think it’s been a universal consensus for the past couple months that the San Francisco 49ers — decimated
            of talent and a winning formula from last offseason’s mass exodus — have been a bonafide dumpster fire.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Despite some bright spots that the team could possibly build on for the future, the inexperience and lack of
            talent has done in these 49ers. That’s why, for a vast majority of the Faithful, a regime change from top to
            bottom is absolutely necessary to reboot the franchise — hopefully for the better.

            Wouldn’t it be nice if CEO Jed York stepped down from the position, the Yorks sold the team off to a

        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            To many, it sounds like a pipe dream. But that’s why this is a wish list.
        </p>
        <br>

        <br>
        <p>
            <b><i>2. The Giants’ two big free agent aces — Johnny Cueto and Jeff Samardzija — playing up to their
                    contracts.</i></b>
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            In the realm of the “more reasonable,” we have what I believe to be the genesis of a fourth even-year World
            Series title for the San Francisco Giants.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            The fact was, the Giants went into the 2015 offseason looking for free agent pitchers to complement staff
            ace Madison Bumgarner. David Price (7 years, $217 million with Boston) passed them by, and they lost out on
            the Zach Greinke Sweepstakes (6 years, $206 million with Arizona). In what looked like a scrambling of a
            Plan B, the Giants signed veteran right-handers Jeff Samardzija (5 years, $90 million) and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7PkI7h2608">Johnny Cueto (6 years, $130 million)</a> to long-term deals.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            While some praised the signings as shrewd business moves for talented innings-eating arms, others deemed
            both signings as high-risk moves that could easily sink the Giants for the future. After all, Samardzija’s
            numbers as of late haven’t been impressive, and Cueto’s health and durability are in question after
            struggles in the second half of the 2015 season.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            But both pitchers’ struggles on American League teams could have been due to extraneous circumstances — for
            example, like playing in the American League. The hope is that a transition back to the National League,
            with a pitcher-friendly home park and an elite defense, will help Samardzija and Cueto regain their peak
            numbers, and, in turn, help bring the Giants back to the Promised Land.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            That’s all a Giants fan could ask for … besides, that is …
        </p>
        <br>
        <hr>
        <br>
        <p>
            <b><i>3. The Giants finding a complementary outfielder to finish off their busy offseason.</i></b>
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Would it have been an early Christmas present for Giants fans to land a talented outfielder like Jason
            Heyward? Sure — despite the fact that it would have destroyed their salary cap. But, he went the way of Jon
            Lester, and went to the North Side of Chicago.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            But I digress.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            There are still viable options for the Giants in the outfield market — particularly left field, where a free
            agent is most needed. They could go to the trade market and sacrifice some promising prospects for, say, a
            Carlos Gonzalez of the Colorado Rockies. That would be fine — depending on who the prospects were.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Signing a Justin Upton away from San Diego or an Alex Gordon from Kansas City would also essentially
            complete the Giants’ dealings until Spring Training, and I think many a Giants fan would be satisfied.
        </p>

            <b><i>4. Trevone Boykin and Josh Doctson finishing their TCU careers beating Oregon in the Alamo
                    Bowl.</i></b>
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            While all-world WR Josh Doctson’s injured wrist won’t allow him to participate in the TCU Horned Frogs’
            Alamo Bowl matchup, it doesn’t take away from the fact that his stellar play throughout the 2015 Big 12
            season got the team as far as they did.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            As for the former WR-turned-potential Heisman candidate QB, Trevone Boykin will try to end his playing
            career in Fort Worth on a high note, beating the Oregon Ducks on January 2nd in San Antonio. And, sure, his
            season was also derailed by injuries and a 2-loss regular season. But things can, at least, be somewhat
            rectified with an Alamo Bowl victory.

            <b><i>5. For Los Angeles to get a football team — but ONLY IF FOOTBALL FANS THERE ACTUALLY WANT ONE.</i></b>
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            The Oakland Raiders might have had their final home game at O.Co Coliseum. The San Diego Chargers might also
            be winding down their time calling Qualcomm Stadium home. Even the St. Louis Rams could see their team
            return to the city from which they departed a little over 20 years ago.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            One of these teams — if not all three — could see themselves playing in the City of Angels come 2016 and
            beyond.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            And, while I weep for the fan bases that may lose their football teams — especially San Diegans (a place
            which I had lived for two years) — I have to hope that one of the biggest media markets in America gets a
            football team. After all, they did play host to both the Rams and Raiders at various times between the 1940s
            and the 1990s. And, lest we forget, Raider Nation in Los Angeles defined rap culture before they before the
            team bolted back to Oakland.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            But there’s only one caveat behind this: I only wish for LA to have an NFL team, if the city really wants
            one. After all, Los Angeles is a gigantic, multi-cultural society. If the city doesn’t bleed for an NFL
            team, does it really deserve one — despite its relative market size?
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            My fear is that the league doesn’t care either way: that one team or more will move to a city that is only
            there because the NFL wants teams there. That seems like a waste, doesn’t it?

            <b><i>6. For Holm-Rousey II NOT to happen … yet.</i></b>
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            I talked about this already, as a vlog, not too long ago. But UFC President Dana White has already
            christened the fight: a rematch between former undefeated Women’s champion Ronda Rousey and current
            undefeated Women’s champion Holly Holm. The anticipated fight is expected to happen in July.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            And I already said my peace about it: I believe this to be folly, on the part of both Rousey and the UFC.
            The fact remains, the former champ is still recovering from a multitude of injuries suffered from the loss
            in November. Rousey will need time, not only to recover, but to figure out a new strategy to beat a healthy
            Holm — one that will likely have had enough time to prepare for whatever Rousey will throw at her —
            ultimately leading to a likely second defeat for Ronda.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            That’s why I still wish that White and the UFC would reconsider the rematch, and throw Holm into a new
            challenge — defending her title against some of the best women in the sport, starting with No. 1 challenger
            Miesha Tate.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            It gives the champ another fight before a possible rematch with Rousey, the fans another opportunity to see
            what else Holm is capable of, and the UFC more hype leading to Rousey’s return, no matter who holds the belt
            at the end of Holm-Tate.

            In the College Football Playoff this New Year’s Eve, I wish for the following to happen:
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Clemson to prove to the country that they won’t roll over as a “soft” No. 1 seed against a dynamic Oklahoma
            offense — probably because I’m a little bitter that this year’s Big 12 Champion was allowed into the CFP,
            and it wasn’t TCU;
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            And Michigan State to stick it to the SEC champs, and eliminate Alabama in the semifinal round for the
            second year in a row — simply because the assumption of SEC dominance must continue to be squashed.
