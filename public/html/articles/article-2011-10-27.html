            MSR's Good Idea, Bad Idea?: October 27, 2011
        </h1>
        <hr>
        <p>
            In the first of what, I hope, to be many in a rundown of various issues in the world of sports, I will offer the final verdict. Was it a good idea, or a bad idea, for the parties involved?
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            It’s fairly straightforward. So, let’s get to it:
        </p>
        <hr>
        
        <p class="text-center">
            <b>Issue:</b> <i>Postponing the World Series on Wednesday night, due to the threat of inclement weather</i>
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            The forecast called for light rain in St. Louis.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            There were rumors that, if the weather trends held serve, Major League Baseball would think about postponing the game. After all, they dealt with this earlier this postseason at Yankee Stadium, for an ALDS Game 1 against Detroit. Then there was Game 2 of the ALCS between the Tigers and Rangers in Arlington. Oh, there was also Game 1 of the ALCS, which was delayed in the fifth inning. Twice.
        </p>
